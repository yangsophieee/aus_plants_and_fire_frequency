Methods for extracting fire response data on resprouting and seeding from [AusTraits](https://austraits.org/) are available in "code/extracting_fire_response_data.Rmd".

Methods for calculating the mean FRI across the distribution of each species/taxon using Poisson Regression are available in "code/mean_fri_poisson_regression_method.Rmd". Methods for using the survival analysis method closely following Simpson et al. (2021) are in "code/median_fri_survival_analysis_method".

The methods for analysing relationships between fire response strategies and fire frequency are available in "code/fire_response_strategies_and_fire_frequency.Rmd". The methods for analysising relationships between fire response strategies and leaf traits are available in "fire_response_strategies_and_leaf_traits.Rmd".

The processes of cleaning GBIF data, making an Australian native plant lookup and a lookup for GBIF/APC taxonomy were borrowed from the following repository: https://github.com/traitecoevo/aus_gbif_clean.
